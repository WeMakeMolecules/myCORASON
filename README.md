# myCORASON
An alternative Version of the corason pipeline, (posted at https://github.com/nselem )  with better phylogenetic trees and other features, flexible and tweakeale, for in house running, it works great on fungal genomes less dependencies, IN PROGRESS!
changes
Uses iqtree
no GbLocks
no conversion of ouputs
Alignments are not trimmed, if aligment fails (large proteins like PKSs NRPSs) the output is still generated. 
Better for large DB (ran in 11000 bacterial genomes
Can take antismash outputs if processed with the GFF_to_OCRASON.pl script

Read me info coming soon

need to work on the input command line stuff :S
